goble
=====

Go implementation of Bluetooth LE support for OSX (derived from noble/bleno)

This is a port of nodejs [noble](https://github.com/sandeepmistry/noble)/[bleno](https://github.com/sandeepmistry/bleno) for OSX only.

Once I have something working it can maybe integrated with [github.com/paypal/gatt](https://github.com/paypal/gatt), that right now is Linux only.

## Installation

    $ go get github.com/raff/goble
